# Pill-Dispensing-Medicine-Assistant
 we made this project in our Engineering 6 semester in Workshop Lab  
 
 Medication adherence is a critical aspect of healthcare management, particularly 
for individuals requiring regular doses of medication. However, remembering to 
take medication at the prescribed times can be challenging, leading to potential 
health risks. To address this issue, we present a medication assistance system 
implemented using an Arduino Uno microcontroller. This system aims to provide 
users with a reliable and user-friendly solution for managing their medication 
schedules effectively.


 Features of Our Proposed Model: 
 
 
● Automated Medicine Dispensing: The system automates the process of 
dispensing medications by utilizing a servo motor to rotate and dispense pills 
from designated slots. This automated dispensing mechanism ensures 
accurate dosage delivery and reduces the risk of medication errors. 
 
● Customizable Alarm Settings: Users can set personalized alarm times for 
medication reminders using the push buttons and OLED display. The system 
provides flexibility for users to adjust alarm settings according to their 
medication schedule and preferences. 
 
● Real-Time Display: The OLED display shows the current date and time 
fetched from the RTC module, providing users with up-to-date information 
for medication management. Additionally, the display offers feedback on 
alarm settings, system status, and user interactions. 
 
● User Interaction: Patients can easily interact with the system using the push 
buttons to select alarms, adjust settings, or acknowledge medication 
reminders. This interface enhances user experience.

● Auditory Cue: When the set alarm time is reached, the system triggers a loud 
sound from the buzzer, alerting users to take their medication. 
Simultaneously, the servo motor dispenses the required pill from the 
designated slot, ensuring timely medication administration. 
 
● Enhanced Medication Adherence: The automated dispensing and timely 
reminders provided by the system help improve medication adherence and 
ensure patients adhere to their prescribed treatment routines. 
 
● User-Friendly Design: Users of all ages and abilities can utilize the system 
thanks to its user-friendly interface and adaptable features, which encourage 
independence and ease of use when managing medications.
